After I found the dose that worked best for me (30mg in the morning and 10-20mg in the afternoon) I felt like a new person. I usually sleep anywhere from 12-18 hours a day when I don\u2019t have classes or work (I don\u2019t have to force myself up on these days with 2 alarms). I can still nap but they are not nearly as long as they used to be (3-8 hours). My grades have improved and most importantly, my attendance of class has improved! I used to sleep through class, but now I can go because my body isn\u2019t begging for sleep. Overall it is an extremely helpful drug to treat narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness. I finally feel like I have my life back! My only complaint is the dry mouth I experience every so often. I also still feel rather tired some days but it is not as NEAR as torturous as it used to be. Overall, it is extremely helpful and it has changed my life for the better.\"",

Despite how well it works, I still seem to yawn almost constantly. I would not be able to get through the day without it. It's not 100 percent fix, but I can function for most of the day using it.

The down side to this medicine, and let me be clear that it is just with my experience is that it can make you jittery and excited. It also gave me \"false confidence\" and just overall made me more outgoing than I usually. Also I found that the first time I used it it gave me quite a high, which I eventually got used to. After several days I started hallucinating things and got paranoid. There are definitely some psychological side effects even more than the ones that I've experienced. \"",

Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.\"",

After a couple months I got up to 20mg daily because the lower doses weren't helping. Make sure to eat something before you take it because if I took it before breakfast I wouldn't eat all day. After 4 months on Adderall 20mg daily it is not helping anymore and if anything made my ADD a lot worse. I'd be in the middle of a conversation and just totally blank. Started taking a lot of effort to think anymore. It also became really hard to do much of anything if I didn't take it. It also made me sweat profusely and gave me very dry and pimply skin. It worked well for a while when I didn't take it every day but when I changed jobs I started taking it daily and it's awful. If you are prescribed this don't take it daily like it's a maintenance drug or it'll fry your brain!!!\"",

They just delay it till the crash comes and you feel 40 times more worse.They have  destroyed the lives of hundreds of people due to prolonged use. They are just street meth.Believe me I have ADHD and the best medicine I would suggest are a non-stimulants like welbutrin and strattera.If they didn't work for you then never ever use stimulants they will ruin your life. Just rely on adaptogens eg rhodiola, ginseng, good diet, exercise and meditation. If study is a problem for you then use you hyperfocus and study something that you are interested in.You may have found some good reviews about these  stimulants however these people are new and they are unaware of there consequences. I have tried stimulants for 15 years so I am confident and sure about what I say.\"",

I had a bad reaction with the first generic brand I tried, tried a different generic brand, and had a better experience. So look into that because not everyone believes that there's such a difference between different brands but to me there was.

Food has such an impact on brain functioning so not eating for 6 hours because you didn't feel like it is a bad habit to start!

Before trying the Adderall and Focalin I was diagnosed with ADHD because I brought it to my doctors attention. I had always had a problem in high school and even middle school with getting good grades, everyone thought I was lazy. In college the situation was getting worse, and I started to get depressed about my bad grades. I then realized my depression was stemming from my inability to concentrate on school work. It's been six months since I've been on the Adderall XR, and my grades have shot up! I get A's and B's in all my classes and am so much more organized which helps with everything in my life.\"",

I find I tend to make lists and start checking things off the list as they are accomplished. I never start something and do not finish it as I did before. I look forward to it. I enjoy work more. I feel less stress and anxiety. I do not feel it is habit forming. There have been times when I have forgotten to take it and I did not notice it. The only difference is normally when I have taken the drug I don't have an appetite and when I forget to take it I tend to eat a lot.\"",
